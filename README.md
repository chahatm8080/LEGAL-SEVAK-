🧩 Project Overview
Legal Sevak is a full-stack eMarketplace platform built to democratize access to legal services in India, especially for underrepresented or digitally unaware citizens. The platform connects users with verified legal professionals including advocates, mediators, notaries, and document writers — all in one unified, transparent system.

Detailed explaination:
In India, the legal service sector is largely unorganized, making it difficult for people to access legal services. Many legal service providers, such as advocates, arbitrators, mediators, notaries, and document writers, operate independently and do not have a centralized platform to offer their services to clients. This leads to a lack of transparency, difficulty in finding the right legal service provider, and high costs for clients. Objective: The objective of this hackathon is to develop an incentivized design to onboard legal service providers on an eMarketplace to extend legal services to citizens in India. Solution: Participants are expected to design a platform that can onboard legal service providers on an eMarketplace and incentivize them to offer their services to clients. The platform should be user-friendly, secure, and transparent, and should address the following challenges: 1. How to incentivize legal service providers to offer their services on the platform? 2. How to ensure transparency and accountability in the services provided by legal service providers? 3. How to ensure the quality of legal services provided by the service providers? 4. How to ensure that clients can easily find the right legal service provider for their specific legal needs? 5. How to ensure that the platform is accessible to citizens from all socio-economic backgrounds? Participants can consider various models for incentivizing legal service providers, such as offering them bonuses, rewards, or other forms of recognition for their services. They can also consider gamification techniques to motivate providers to offer quality services and compete with each other on the platform. Additionally, they can explore ways to integrate the platform with other legal service providers and institutions, such as courts, legal aid clinics, and bar associations. Deliverables: The deliverables for this hackathon are a functional prototype of the e-marketplace platform, including wireframes,
